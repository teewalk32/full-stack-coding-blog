# full-stack-coding-blog

## Description

I was motivatied to complete this project because I wanted to make a blog to help teach a user about full stack coding.  This website will have different post on my blog that will have links and descriptions on Full-Stack developing. Making your own personal blog will also be and option for the user. Building this webpage helped me get a better understanding on the log-in/out, sign-up and how to use handlebars in HTML.
